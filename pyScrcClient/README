This is a Python client for the Simulated Car Racing Championship 2012

 I'm sharing my code that implements a client for the SCRC.
Its devided in 5 files:

pyclient.py: main file, you can make it executable on linux and it has the same command line parameters as the C++/Java client.

driver.py: file holding the driver class, with a method drive that should hold drive the car.

carState.py: file holding the car state class, the state can be updated with a message from the torcs server.

carControl.py: file holding the car control class, the control parameters can be set and then transformed in a message for the torcs server

msgParser.py: file holding a parser class for translating the torcs server message in usable variables and vice versa
